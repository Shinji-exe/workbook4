Objects

Many programming languages allow programmers to create "objects" in their code;

-In real life, an object is a "thing" or noun that has many properties associated with it.

-For example: student,courses,customer policy

Once you figure out what object you want to model, you have to figure out what properties you need to represent it.

-For example, an Employee might have the following properties:
*employeeId
*name
*jobTitle
*payRate

JavaScript Objects

JavaScript allows you to declare objects with values for each property

-Properties are written as name and value pairs that are separated by a colon;

Example

let emp = {
    employeeId: "1",
    name: "Ezra",
    jobTitle: "Theater Teacher",
    payRate : "38.46"
}

Accessing Objects Properties

You can access object properties in two ways 

objectName.propertyName 

or

objectName["propertyName"]

Example

let emp1 = {
        employeeId: "1",
    name: "Ezra",
    jobTitle: "Theater Teacher",
    payRate : "38.46"
}

let emp2 = {
        employeeId: "2",
    name: "Elisha",
    jobTitle: "Game Developer",
    payRate : "43.27"
}

console.log("Employee1: " + emp1.name) //Dot notation
console.log("Employee2: " + emp2.name) //Dot notation

or

console.log("Employee1: " + emp1["name"]); //bracket notation
console.log("Employee2: " + emp2["name"])
